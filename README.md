# 🇬🇧 BBC NEWS CLASSIFICATION PROJECT 
## *(Unsupervised Learning Project)*
#### 🏫 University of Colorado, Boulder - Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning 



**Overview**

This project looks at an unsupervised learning model technique called matrix factorization. All the required libraries to run the notebook are in the first coding cell. This notebook explores the training data while using common natural language processing techniques. Our goal is to classify different news articles into five different groups: business, tech, sport, entertainment or politics. We will train two models: (1) an unsupervised model using matrix factorization and then compare it with (2) a supervised model using KMeans clustering. Both models are submitted to have their testing accuracy. 


**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)🥸** 

In this section we will explore the data given for the competition. It is important to look at what you have to work with before beginning any model building or model training. Normally, it is suggested to first split the data into training and testing sets before any EDA because you, as a researcher, do not want to be biased for the results which can lead to overfitting. For this reason, we will not visualize or explore the test data given, and use that data only for testing the models. 

**2. Model Building and Training 🦾**

Next, we will build multiple unsupervised models and train them on the test data. Once we have at least two strong models built, we will fine-tune those models and test on the test dataset. We will be using the train-test split on this dataset that is already given in the CSV files.

**3. Model Comparisons 🧐**

Once we have good, working models we will compare them for their performance. We will discuss which model is the best out of the models tested and why. 

**4. Conclusions 🤓**

Finally, we will summary the project and results, including future suggestions for further analysis.
